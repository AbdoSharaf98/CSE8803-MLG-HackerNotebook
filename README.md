This is an Python implementation of the paper [Higher-order organization of complex networks](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad9029) by Benson et al. (2016).

This implementation was done for the course CSE 8803 - Machine Learning with Graphs at Georgia Tech. It was based on the [official implementation](https://github.com/arbenson/higher-order-organization-julia) written originally in Julia
